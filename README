This is Octopi, a powerful Pacman/Yaourt frontend using Qt libs. 
================================================================

The project's source code is hosted at https://github.com/aarnt/octopi.

You'll need a privilege escalation tool to use it, once running as 
root will ONLY work in KDE. Octopi supports kdesu and gksu for that.

Enjoy!
