This is Octopi, a powerful Pacman/Yaourt frontend using Qt libs. 
================================================================

The project's source code is hosted at 
	https://github.com/aarnt/octopi.

You'll need a privilege escalation tool to use it, once running as 
root will ONLY work in KDE. Octopi supports kdesu and gksu for that.

Do you understand english? Wanna help this project?
You can translate it to your mother language at 
	https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/octopi/.

Enjoy!
