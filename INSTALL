Installing Octopi is a pretty straightforward task. 

Assuming you have updated Qt4(*) libs installed in your system, all 
you have to do is run:

	makepkg -f

Wait for the compilation and then install the generated package (as 
root), using:

	pacman -U [--force] <nameOfTheGeneratedOctopiPackage.tar.xz>

You can also install the generated package notifier, using:

	pacman -U [--force] <nameOfTheGeneratedOctopiNotifierPackage.tar.xz>

Octopi is located at the system utilities menu of your Desktop 
Environment.


Enjoy!

(*) Octopi is also Qt5 compatible, you'll only have to adjust the 
"depends" section in PKGBUILD.

If you are compiling Octopi in a KDE centric-distro like KaOS and Chakra, you should 
first uncomment the "#define NO_GTK_STYLE" string located at "src/main.cpp" and 
"notifier/octopi-notifier/main.cpp", otherwise it won't compile at all.
